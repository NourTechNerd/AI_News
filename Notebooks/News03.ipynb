    "### What is an Word embedding?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is typically a numerical vector that represents this word in a high-dimensional space.In a way thet similar words are close to each other in this space.\n",
    "  - Example : \n",
    "     - Word embedding of the word \"cat\" is closer to the word \"dog\" and \"bird\" than to the word \"car\".\n",
    "     - Word embedding of \"dog\" is close one of \"Pit bull\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### How an Embedding model is trained?\n",
    "\n",
    "- An Embedding model is juat a Neural Network.\n",
    "- There are several ways to train an Embedding model, one of them train the model to classify tokens in a corpus.\n",
    "    - The model composed of:\n",
    "      -  a hidden layer with identity activation function with number of neurons equal to the size of the embedding vector.\n",
    "      -  a Output layer with softmax activation function with number of neurons equal to the number of tokens in the corpus.\n",
    "    -  A loss function that is the cross entropy between the predicted probabilities and the true labels.\n",
    "    - Finally, the wights of hidden layer are our embedding vectors.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps of Training an Embedding Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect a corpus of text.\n",
    "2. Preprocess the corpus (Lowercasing, stemming, stop word removal, etc.).\n",
    "3. Tokenize the corpus.\n",
    "4. Build the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inference :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tokenize the input text.\n",
    "2. Look up the tokens in the vocabulary.(Map the token with his specific id)\n",
    "3. Map Ids with embedding vectors.\n",
    "4. MaxPooling or MeanPooling => The output is one embedding vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probleme for Unkown tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. if the embedding model doesn't recognize the token, it will assing special token to it like <unk>, this special token has a static embedding vector.\n",
    "=> The Quality of the sentence embedding is reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "- We may finetune the embedding model in our specific dataset, so when it comes to inference it knows all the tokens.\n",
